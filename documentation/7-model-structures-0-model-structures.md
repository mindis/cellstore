Model Structure
===============

In the previous chapters, we introduced report elements. There are six kinds of them (Concept, Abstract, Line Items, Hypercube, Dimension and Member).

In a component, the report elements are glued together in a meaningful way. This allows:
- the retrieval of the facts associated with the components, as a fact table.
- the correct, and possibly even fancy display of these facts, as a spreadsheet.

Fact tables and Spreadsheets are described in further chapters.

The model structure of a component is nothing else than a hierarchy organizing its report elements.

Spreadsheet analogy
-------------------
In a spreadsheet, the model structure corresponds to how a table looks like: where the header cells are located, how the rows are organized and the headers indented.
