Model Structure Metadata
========================

The metadata available depends on the profile. However, there are a few fields that are always here:

- *Name*: The name of the report element.
- *Label*: The label of the report element, with its preferred label role and in the original language.
- *Kind*: The kind of the report element (one of the six Concept, Abstract, LineItems, Hypercube, Dimension or Member).
- *Depth*: The depth of the report element (1 being the root).
- *Order*: The order of the report element among its siblings.

For Concepts, the same fields as for report elements appear in addition.
