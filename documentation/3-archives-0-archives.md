#Archives

Archives are the bundles in which entities put the facts that they submit to a regulation authority such as the SEC in the United States or the FSA in Japan, together with their own taxonomy.

The archives interface provides metadata about the archives that are present in the cell store, such as which entity filed it, when it was filed or accepted, which fiscal year and period it corresponds to if it's a fiscal report, and also some statistics about the number of facts it contains, etc.

##Spreadsheet analogy

Archives can be though of as Excel files. An Excel file is saved with an .xlsx extension, an Archive is saved with a .xbrl extension. What is inside (i.e., the XBRL syntax) is irrelevant to business users. These details are hidden to them.
