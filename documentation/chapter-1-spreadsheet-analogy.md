##Analogy With spreadsheets

For users used to spreadsheet software such as Excel, the following table shows a rough correspondence between the two paradigms.


| Cell store     | Spreadsheet                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Entity         | User                                |
| Archive        | Excel file                          |
| Component      | Sheet                               |
| Fact           | Data cell                           |
| Report element | Header cell                         |
| XBRL syntax    | Internal structure of an Excel file |
| Fact table     | Raw display of a pivot table        |
