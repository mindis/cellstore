Components
==========

Within an archive, facts are organized in components. In a fiscal filing, for example, there is very often a Balance Sheet component, an Income Statement component, etc.

Components contain both metadata (that is, report elements glued together in a meaningful way) and data (facts). However, the data is decoupled from the components, so that several components may share the same facts.

Spreadsheet analogy
-------------------

Components can be compared with single sheets within the same Excel file.
