Generic Metadata

The metadata available depends on the profile. However, there are a few fields that are always here:

- *_id*: The AID of the archive.
- *Entity*: The entity which filed this archive (i.e., one of its Entity IDs).

Japan-specific Metadata

In the Japanese profile, there are a few more:
- *FilingKinds*: The filing kinds with which the archive was stamped.
- *SubmissionDate*: The data at which the filing was filed.
- *DocumentPeriodEndDate*: The last day of the fiscal period.
- *DocumentFiscalPeriodFocus*: The fiscal period for which the filing is filed (FY, Q1, ...).
- *DocumentFiscalYearFocus*: The fiscal year for which the filing is filed.
