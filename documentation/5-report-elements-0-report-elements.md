Report Elements
===============

A component is used to group facts in a meaningful way within a filing, for example to build a BalanceSheet or an IncomeStatement.

These grouped facts can be shown to developers or to business users in several fancy ways: fact tables, spreadsheets. These will be shown in the next chapters.

But before, we go into these, we need to give a few more details about what the internal structure of a component: the building blocks that hold the facts together, like glue.

A component is made of so-called *Report Elements*. Report Elements are metadata.

Spreadsheet analogy
-------------------

Report elements can be seen as header (row or column) cells in a spreadsheet. Line items, abstracts and concepts are most often used as row headers, while dimensions and members are used as column headers.
