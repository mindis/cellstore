##Component Metadata

###Generic Metadata

The metadata available depends on the profile. However, there are a few fields that are always here:

- *Archive*: The AID of the archive to which the component belongs.
- *Role*: The Role of the component within this archive.
- *Label*: A human-readable label for the component.
- Some statistics (NumRules, NumNetworks, ...) on the contents of the component, including report elements. More will follow in the next chapters.

###Japan-specific Metadata

In the Japanese profile, there is also:
- *Disclosure*: The disclosure with which the component was stamped, if available.
