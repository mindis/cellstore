##Look up an entity

Let us begin with a very simple query that just retrieves a company, say, Canon. Canon's ticker is 7751.

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751&token=c3049752-4d35-43da-82a2-f89f1b06f7a4
```

If you look at the output, you will see that it's JSON. It contains some meta information such as the time of the request, and some statistics. In this example, the database contains 10 entities, and one is being returned.
The entities that have been requested (in this case just one) are in the Entities array. All other endpoints have this same structure (metainformation and array containing results).

    {
      "Comment" : "Generated by 28.io, for more information see http://www.28.io/xbrl (2015-02-17T17:08:33.211081Z)",
      "Statistics" : {
        "NumEntities" : 1,
        "TotalNumEntities" : 10
      },
      "Entities" : [ ... ]
    }
