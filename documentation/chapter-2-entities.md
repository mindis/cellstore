#Entities
Companies submit fiscal filings (which are archives) to the FSA.

In the XBRL world, companies correspond to reporting *entities*. The entities interface provides metadata, such as name, ticker, etc, about the entities against which data has been stored in the cell store.

Entities can be identified in ways that differ from profile to profile. For many profiles, the ticker is available and the format of the ticker (ko, 7751, ...) depends on the country. Other codes are available depending on the regulation authority, such as the EDINET code in Japan. Often, entities are also tagged with  stock indices (DOW30, NIKKEI, ...).

There is an identifier, though, that is available across all profiles: the Entity ID, even though its format may still vary depending on the profile.

##Looking Up A Company
Let us begin with a very simple query that just retrieves a company, say, Canon. Canon's ticker is 7751.

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751
```

If you look at the output, you will see that it's JSON. It contains some meta information such as the time of the request, and some statistics. In this example, the database contains 10 entities, and one is being returned.
The entities that have been requested (in this case just one) are in the Entities array. All other endpoints have this same structure (metainformation and array containing results).

    {
      "Comment" : "Generated by 28.io, for more information see http://www.28.io/xbrl (2015-02-17T17:08:33.211081Z)",
      "Statistics" : {
        "NumEntities" : 1,
        "TotalNumEntities" : 10
      },
      "Entities" : [ ... ]
    }

##Output formats

The data can also be obtained in other formats, such as XML, HTML and CSV.

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751&format=xml
```

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751&format=csv
```

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?ticker=7751&format=html
```

##Other ways of identifying a company

You can identify a company with its EDINET code like so:

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?edinetcode=E02274
```

Also, companies all have some EIDs that are used by regulatory authorities. These EIDs are used to associate each chunk of data with the entity that it applies to. If a chunk of data, say, the non-consolidated assets for the fiscal year 2014, is stamped with an EID that belongs to Canon, then you know that these assets are those of Canon.

An entity may have several EIDs. For example, Japanese taxonomies have an EID against the TDNET repository, as well as an EID for the former generations of EDINET taxonomies, and an EID for the next-generation EDINET taxonomy.

An EID is always made of an URI scheme followed by an identifier. For example, this is the TDNET EID of Canon:

    http://www.tse.or.jp/sicc 77510

Although it is less common and not very practical, you can use the eid parameter to retrieve an entity with its EID. You will need to URL-encode the space with %20, as well as any other special characters that might be in here.

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?eid=http://www.tse.or.jp/sicc%2077510
```

##Getting companies by stock index

You can retrieve all companies in an index with a single call. Here is an example with the NIKKEI:

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?tag=NIKKEI
```

##Mixing parameters

If you use multiple parameters, it will accumulate the companies as you add more parameters:

```REST
http://edinet.28.io/v1/_queries/public/api/entities.jq?edinetcode=E02274&ticker=9432&tag=NIKKEI
```
